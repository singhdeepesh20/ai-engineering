# The Rise of AI Engineering


1. From Language Models → LLMs → AI Engineering

* Language models have existed since the 1950s.

* Progress over decades + self-supervision enabled today’s large language models (LLMs).

* Apps like ChatGPT or Copilot are not sudden inventions — they’re the result of many breakthroughs in modeling language at scale.

2. What is a Language Model?

* A language model predicts how likely a word (or token) is in a given context.

* Example: “My favorite color is __” → “blue” is more likely than “car.”

* Core concept: it encodes the statistical structure of language.

* Rooted in history: Sherlock Holmes (1905) used letter frequency; Claude Shannon (1951) formalized it with entropy.
